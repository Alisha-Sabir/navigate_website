        description: "As a Founding Agent of Compass, I was frustrated with prospecting. I spent hours gathering property and ownership data, only to find it inaccurate. I wanted to be out in the field, building relationships, but was stuck behind a screen.Most agents accepted this inefficiency, but I knew there could be a  better way. I envisioned a platform that would remove these  barriers, provide accurate data, and allow agents to focus on building relationships and growing their business. Navigate isn’t just a tool—it’s the solution I wish I had when I first started. And now, it’s changing the way agents approach prospecting forever",
